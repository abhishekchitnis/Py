I just manually created the missing registry key and it stopped logging that.

Jarmake... How did you do it?

Please share the steps to add registry key.

Ok.

Open registry with regedit (just click on Windows start menu and start typing regedit, it should come up)
From the registry explorer, expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and from there expand SOFTWARE
Expand Policies.
I was missing everything from this point.
So what I had to do was to select the Policies by left clicking on it, and then right click and from the context menu select New > Key and name it Google.
Once that is created, select that and right click and again select New > Key and name that Chrome.
Select that folder, and right click. Choose New > String. Name it as MachineLevelUserCloudPolicyEnrollmentToken and leave the value empty.
If you alreade have Google and Chrome under Policies, I think only adding the key as in step 6 should work. I've attached a picture to show how it should look like when it's done.
And just as a clarifier. This is under SOFTWARE/Policies, not directly under SOFTWARE.
