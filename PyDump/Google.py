I just manually created the missing registry key and it stopped logging that.

Jarmake... How did you do it?

Please share the steps to add registry key.

 @jarmake
jarmake commented on Jun 19 â€¢ 
Ok.

Open registry with regedit (just click on Windows start menu and start typing regedit, it should come up)
From the registry explorer, expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and from there expand SOFTWARE
Expand Policies.
I was missing everything from this point.
So what I had to do was to select the Policies by left clicking on it, and then right click and from the context menu select New > Key and name it Google.
Once that is created, select that and right click and again select New > Key and name that Chrome.
Select that folder, and right click. Choose New > String. Name it as MachineLevelUserCloudPolicyEnrollmentToken and leave the value empty.
If you alreade have Google and Chrome under Policies, I think only adding the key as in step 6 should work. I've attached a picture to show how it should look like when it's done.
And just as a clarifier. This is under SOFTWARE/Policies, not directly under SOFTWARE.
